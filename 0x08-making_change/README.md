# Making Change

## Overview
This project tackles the classic coin change problem using dynamic programming. The objective is to find the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This implementation ensures correctness and efficiency by utilizing dynamic programming principles.

## File Structure
- `0-making_change.py`: Python script containing the `makeChange` function to solve the coin change problem.
- `0-main.py`: Main file for testing the `makeChange` function with sample test cases.

## Usage
To test the `makeChange` function, run the `0-main.py` script. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system.

```bash
./0-main.py
